   This software is a computer program whose purpose is to allow the
   edition of TURTLE analysis, design and deployment diagrams, to
   allow the generation of RT-LOTOS or Java code from this diagram,
   and at last to allow the analysis of formal validation traces
   obtained from external tools, e.g. RTL from LAAS-CNRS and CADP
   from INRIA Rhone-Alpes.
