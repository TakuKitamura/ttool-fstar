This software is a computer program whose purpose is to allow the 
edition of TURTLE analysis, design and deployment diagrams, to 
allow the generation of RT-LOTOS or Java code from this diagram, 
and at last to allow the analysis of formal validation traces 
obtained from external tools, e.g. RTL from LAAS-CNRS and CADP 
from INRIA Rhone-Alpes.
