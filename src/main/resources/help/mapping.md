# Mapping

The mapping consists in:

- [mapping tasks](file://taskmapping.md) to execution nodes: to CPUs, to FPGAS, to hardware accelerators (a.k.a. HwAs).
- mapping communication channels to communication paths built upon buses, bridges, memories.

If a user makes an incomplete mapping of communication channels, TTool automatically decides of a channel mapping.
