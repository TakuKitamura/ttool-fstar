## Scheduling policy

The arbitration policy used by OS to schedule mapped tasks

### Round-robin

Tasks are considered one after the other, with a maximum execution time (slot). Priorities are not taken into account.

### Round-robin priority-based

Similar to Round-robin, but priorities are taken into account, "0" being the highest priority.
