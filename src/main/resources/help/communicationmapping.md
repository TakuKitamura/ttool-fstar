# Communication Mapping

## Definition

Communication mapping consists in mapping data channel communications to buses and memories, thus building a physical communication path for functional-level channels.

## Corner cases

If a channel is not mapped to a communication path, then TTool automatically generates a communication path among the possible ones. Similarly, if a communication channel is only partially mapped, TTool completes the communication path.
