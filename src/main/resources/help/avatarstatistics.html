    <p>
        Once several simulation have been performed, the following statistics can
        be displayed as curves. Data are listed in a left tree. A right click on a
        data makes it possible to show a specific curve or to save the related
        data in CSV format.
    </p>
    <h2 id="simulation-time">Simulation time</h2>
    <p>
        The frequency of simulation times can be shown as histogram or pie chart
    </p>
    <h2 id="blocks">Blocks</h2>
    <h3 id="attributes">Attributes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                “all values”. The frequency of the different values taken by the
                attribute can be show as histrogram, pie chart. The evolution of the
                different values can also be show in function of the time.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                “last value”. Same as “all values” but considering only the last value
                taken by this attribute in all simulations.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                “individual evolution”. Display in function of the time how the value
                of this attribute as evolved in each simulation. All evolutions can be
                displayed at a a time, or the evolution in each simulation, by
                reaching the leaf of each attribute evolution, can be displayed.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The time of each tr</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="states">States</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                The time at each last transactions of simulation can be displayed as
                histogram or pie chart
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                For each state, one can display the number of times it has been
                reached in function of time. Also, this frequency value can be
                displayed as histogram or pie chart for all simulation, or for each
                simulation (reach the leaves of each state for this). For instance, if
                state “s0” has been reached 40 times at time 2 and 40 times at time
                10, this histogram will represent at x = “40” y = “2”.
