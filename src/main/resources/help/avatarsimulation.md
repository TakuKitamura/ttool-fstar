# AVATAR Simulation

Avatar models can be simulated using a simulator integrated in TTool.

This simulator is interactive in the sens that the user can pilot the simulation (go one step ahead, run to next breakpoint, reset) and gets feedback as a sequence diagram or directly on models (blocks, state machines).

The simulator also allows to run x simulations (e.g. 100 simulations) and to get statistics on these simulations.
