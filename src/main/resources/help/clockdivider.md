## Clock divider

The clock divider specifies the operating clock frequency of the corresponding hardware node.

It is expressed via a number that is used to divide the global design
frequency, whose default value is 200 MHz. Thus a clock divider equal to 4 means that the CPU operates at 200/4 = 50 MHz
