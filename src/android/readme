How to compile and execute?
---------------------------

I have done as follows on my Mac.

To compile:
$ant debug

Beware, the application is not signed.
The usual way to compile it is to do:
$ant release

Then, start the android emulator, and select your target
$android avd

Install your application on the emulator:
$adb install bin/appli.apk

List devices connected to your PC / Mac:
$adb devices

Installing apk on your phone / tablet via usb
$adb install bin/appli.apk

Removing the application
*adb uninstall appli.apk
