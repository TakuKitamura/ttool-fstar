TTool, an open-source UML toolkit for modeling embedded systems and procotols.
TTool is developed at ENST, http://ttool.telecom-paristech.fr
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Directory generally configured as the one for saving diagram captures performed from TTool, and the HTML/Latex documentation that can be generated from TTool.

Two latex sources are generated:
* One using a png-based capture of the diagrams
* Another one using the svg-based diagram capture.
To compile the generated latex source code, (you must have inkscape installed) simply type:
$ make all

If you wish to compile the png-version of the generated latex, you may also simply do:
$ pdflatex doc.tex
