# To know which version of Java compiler you have, do as follows:
$ javac --version

# Then, you can compile TTool
$ make all&&make install

#To avoid running all the tests and compiling only TTool, ytou may try:
$ make ttoolnotests&&make install

#To start TTool, this is recommended to use your own version of ttool.exe and config.xml

$ cp ttool.exe myttool.exe
$ cp bin/config.xml bin/myconfig.xml

#edit myttool.exe and replace config.xml with myconfig.xml

#start TTool
$ ./myttool.exe


Enjoy!!
