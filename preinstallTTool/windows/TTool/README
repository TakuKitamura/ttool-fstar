Installing TTool
----------------

Basically, TTool is offered as a gipped-tar archive. To uncompress it under Linux, type the following command (if we assume thar archive is named ttool.tgz) in the directory in which you wish to install TTool:
$ tar -xofz ttool.tgz

Various directories are created. A README_<directory name> file located in each of them summarizes its purpose and content.
