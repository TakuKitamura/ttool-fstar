/*
  Xicu is a tricky device. It is a composite device with
  * programmable timers
  * IPI endpoints
  * Hardware irq lines
  * A multi-output ICU concentrating all these

  In MutekH, devices must have only one output IRQ line, and devices
  can only be one class at a time.  Hopefully, ICU class handles IPIs,
  and there is actually one ICU per output line. So we'll have
  (n_output_lines + 1) devices for handling the Xicu.
  
  There will be:
  * 1 device in the timer class, handled by the code in xicu-soclib.c,
    this device is the root of the Xicu code, and actually handles
    all the IRQ routing;
  * n_output_lines "filter" devices in the icu class handling the IRQ
    routing for each output line, these devices actually rely on the
    root.

  First device to initialize is the "root" (timer) one. It only needs
  the following attributes:
  * count of hardware irq lines
  * count of timers
  * count of IPI endpoints
  * address of device
  * (no ICU device is needed)

  Then, initialize the "filter" devices. The following attributes are
  needed:
  * output line number in the xicu
  * parent "root" device reference
  * a valid icu device and irq
  * (no address is needed)
