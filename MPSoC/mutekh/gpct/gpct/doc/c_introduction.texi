GPCT is a set of @strong{general purpose templates} for C programming
language implemented using C preprocessor meta-programming.

It provides @strong{container data structures}, @strong{object
allocation management}, bitmaps and other features.

Container templates are able to store user structure based objects and
raw data with @strong{different algorithms and behaviors}.  Containers
can use different @strong{locking mechanisms} to run on threaded environments.

@strong{Object management templates} can be used to add
constructor/destructor and @strong{reference counting capabilities} to
a structure based object. Reference counting can be handled by
associated containers used to store objects.
