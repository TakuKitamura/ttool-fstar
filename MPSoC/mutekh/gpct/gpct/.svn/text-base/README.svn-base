GPCT is a set of general purpose templates for C programming
language implemented using C preprocessor meta-programming.

It provides container data structures, object allocation
management, bitmaps and other features.

Container templates are able to store user structure based objects and
raw data with different algorithms and behaviors. Containers can use
different locking mechanisms to run on threaded environments.

Object management templates can be used to add
constructor/destructor and reference counting capabilities to
a structure based object. Reference counting can be handled by
associated containers used to store objects.
