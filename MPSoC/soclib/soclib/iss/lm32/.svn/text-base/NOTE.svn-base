There is an error in the lm32 oficial documentation (as of August 2007)
For the "branch if greater" instructions (bg, bgu, bge, bgeu),
The documentation specifies the instruction format as follow:
    OPCODE|RY|RX|ImmBranch
And says that the branch is taken if (RX > RY) (respectivelly >=), but it seems
that the comparison should be done in the reverse order.

This is confirmed by the simulator source code given with gdb.
(
    The corresponding files are :
    gdb/sim/lm32/sem-switch.c
    gdb/sim/common/cgen-ops.h
)
The instructions format is :
    OPCODE|R0|R1|ImmBranch
And the comparison is R0>R1   (using the macro GTSI (R0,R1))
