             HOW TO COMPILE AND SIMULATE THE DECODER H.264

*****************************************************************************/

First step: Compilation of the H.264 Decoder software.
----------
1) Go to the MutekH directory
2) Type the following command
   % make CONF=directoryofH264decoder/config_mips_1proc
Note: 3 different configurations are given with the decoder. One running on a platform with only 1 processor (config_mips_1proc), a second with 2 processors (config_mips_2proc), and a last one running with 4 processors (config_mips_4proc).
      According to the configuration file you chose, the platform with be adapted.
3) Now, the binary file has been created, named "kernel-soclib-mips.out".

Note: MutekH has generated some configuration file, named ".config.h", ".config.m4", ".config.mk" and ".config.py".


Second step: Compilation of the H.264 Decoder platform.
-----------
1) Go to the plaform directory
2) Check the symbolic links to MutekH. If it's wrong, type:
   % ln -s pathtoMutekHdirectory
2) Type the following command
   % make
3) Now the platform is compiled

Note: when compiling, the platform uses configuration files generated by MutekH, in order to adapt the platform to the configuration file defined when compiling the software.


Third step: Launch the simulation.
----------
Type the following command:
% ./h264_platform.x mutekh/kernel-soclib-mips.out

The simulation start and open a TTY terminal where you can see some decoding informations, and a framebuffer where the decoded video is displayed.
